# IntelliJ IDEA

We provide two IntelliJ KCL plugins:

- IntelliJ KCL: The basic version of the KCL plugin provides syntax highlighting and keyword completion. It is compatible with multiple versions of IntelliJ IDE.
- IntelliJ KCL LSP: This plugin is implemented based on the [Language Server Protocolï¼ˆLSP)](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide) and offers additional features such as diagnostics, completion, and hovering. However, due to certain limitations, it can only be used with specific versions.

> The integration with the Language Server Protocol is created as an extension to the paid IntelliJ-based IDEs. Therefore, plugins using Language Server integration are not available in Community releases of JetBrains products and Android Studio from Google.
> Starting with the 2023.2 release cycle, the LSP API is publicly available as part of the IntelliJ Platform in the following IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm Professional, DataSpell, RubyMine, CLion, Aqua, DataGrip, GoLand, Rider, and RustRover.

## IntelliJ KCL

The basic version of the KCL plugin can be directly downloaded and used from the IntelliJ Plugin Marketplace. It provides syntax highlighting and keyword completion.

Additionally, you need to install the [kcl-language-server](https://www.kcl-lang.io/docs/user_docs/getting-started/install#install-language-server) and verify that the `kcl-language-server` command is in your PATH. Here are the steps for different operating systems:

  For macOS and Linux:

  ```bash
  which kcl-language-server
  ```

  For Windows:

  ```bash
  where kcl-language-server
  ```
