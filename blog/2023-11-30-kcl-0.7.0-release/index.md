## Introduction

The KCL team is pleased to announce that KCL v0.7.0 is now available! This release has brought three key updates to everyone: **Language**, **Tools**, and **Integrations**.

- _Use KCL language, tools and IDE extensions with more complete features and fewer errors to improve code writing experience and efficiency._

- _The new KCL CLI integrates KCL package management, doc, test and other peripheral ecosystems._

- _The rich KCL third-party library market artifacthub.io provides more than 200 KCL third-party libraries for you to choose from._

KCL v0.7.0 is now available for download at [KCL v0.7.0 Release Page](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/releases/tag/v0.7.0) or [KCL Official Website](https://kcl-lang.io).

[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl) is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). KCL improves the writing of numerous complex configurations, such as cloud-native scenarios, through its mature programming language technology and practice. It is dedicated to building better modularity, scalability, and stability around configurations, simpler logic writing, faster automation, and great built-in or API-driven integrations.

This blog will introduce the content of KCL v0.7.0 and recent developments in the KCL community to readers.

## Language Updates

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New KCL CLI

When compiling, use `kcl`, when downloading packages, use `kpm`, if you have a KCL model that you want to send to the cluster, you also need to use `kusion`, kcl is the compilation command, `kpm run` can also be compiled, I also found `kusion compile` in the kusion command line, do you have the same confusion, what is the relationship between these tools? How do I use them?

For this reason, we provide you with a new KCL CLI, the goal is to include the KCL ecosystem together, to provide you with a unified and concise operation page, everything, one-click direct.

The new KCL CLI will continue to use `kcl` as the command prefix, and currently provides multiple sub-commands including compilation, package management, and formatting tools.

### üîß Diagnostic Information Optimization

We have tried to add repair suggestions in some error messages. If you are frustrated by the KCL compilation failure, you may wish to listen to the compiler's suggestions.

```python
import sub as s1

The_first_kcl_program = s.The_first_kcl_program
```

Let's listen to what the compiler says. You may have written `s1` as `s` by mistake.

![did you mean](/img/blog/2023-11-30-kcl-0.7.0-release/did-you-mean.png)

KCL cannot find the third-party library used in the package? Try `kcl mod add`, if it still doesn't work, we have prepared more than 200 KCL models for you on artifacthub.io, come and have a look, there is always one that suits you!

![try-kcl-mod-add](/img/blog/2023-11-30-kcl-0.7.0-release/try-kcl-mod-add.png)

### üöÄ Language Writing Experience Optimization

#### Removed indentation check in some code blocks

In some code blocks, whether the indentation is aligned has become less important.

If your code is written like this

```python
schema TestIndent:
    name: str
    msg: str
    id: int

test_indent = TestIndent {
                    name = "test"
  msg = "test"
              id = 1
}
```

In the past, you may have encountered a lot of red errors, but now this is not a mistake, `kcl fmt` will help you tidy it up.

![kcl-fmt](/img/blog/2023-11-30-kcl-0.7.0-release/kclfmt.gif)

#### Lambda expression type annotation

In the new version of KCL, we have added type annotations for lambda expressions, and you can write lambda with type annotations in the new version of KCL.

```python
schema Test:
    name: str

identity: (Test) -> bool = lambda res: Test -> bool {
    res.name == "hello"
}

c = identity(Test { name = "hello" })
```

### üèÑ API Updates

- New KCL unit test API: _[https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/pull/904](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/pull/904)_
- KCL schema parsing API enhancement version `GetFullSchemaType` supports obtaining KCL package related information with third-party libraries. _[https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/pull/906](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/pull/906)_
- New KCL symbol renaming API: _[https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/pull/890](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/pull/890)_

### üêû Other Updates and Bug Fixes

## IDE & Toolchain Updates

### IDE Updates

#### KCL IDE supports goto reference and renaming of symbols

IDE supports goto reference of symbols, using `goto reference` or `find all references`:

![find-ref](/img/docs/tools/Ide/vs-code/FindRefs.png)

IDE supports renaming of symbols:

![rename](/img/docs/tools/Ide/vs-code/Rename.gif)

#### IDE supports formatting of import statements and union types

We have optimized the behavior of blank lines between import statements and other code blocks (formatted as one blank line) and the behavior of spaces between union types (formatted as separated by `|`):

![fmt](/img/blog/2023-10-25-kcl-biweekly-newsletter/Format.gif)

#### KCL IDE has added a lot of completion prompts

We have added a lot of completion prompts for the **configuration definition**, which simplifies the user's mind of writing configuration based on the model and improves the efficiency of configuration editing. In addition, the parameter completion when calling the built-in function is enhanced. Talk is cheap, let's take a look at the effect directly:

![func-completion](/img/blog/2023-11-08-biweekly-newsletter/module-function-completion.gif)

![conf-completion](/img/blog/2023-11-08-biweekly-newsletter/config-completion.gif)

And for the **model design**, we have also added a quick generation of docstring to reduce the boilerplate of typing by hand:

![gen-docstring](/img/blog/2023-11-08-biweekly-newsletter/docstring-gen.gif)

#### Performance

- KCL has designed and restructured a new semantic model, as well as an API that supports nearest symbol search and symbol semantic information query.
- The migration of IDE completion, jump, and hover functions to new semantic models significantly reduces the difficulty and code volume of IDE development.
- The KCL compiler supports syntax incremental parsing and semantic incremental checking, which improves the performance of KCL compilation, construction, and IDE plugin usage in most scenarios by **5-10 times**.

#### KCL IDE other updates and bug fixes

- KCL IDE extension for IntelliJ 2023.2+
- Fix the problem that the language service virtual file system related bug: the file dimension change will cause the language service to crash and must be restarted to recover, which has now been fixed.
- Support import statement completion of external package dependencies introduced by package management tools
- Fix the display position of the function parameter undefined type error

### Test Tool Updates

Are you worried that your KCL program is written incorrectly? Why not come and test it? This update provides a new KCL test tool.

The new KCL test tool supports writing unit tests using KCL lambda and executing tests using the tool.

You can write your test cases through lambda expressions in the file with the suffix `_test.k`.

```python
import .app

# Convert the `App` model into Kubernetes Deployment and Service Manifests
test_kubernetesRender = lambda {
    a = app.App {
        name = "app"
        containers.ngnix = {
            image = "ngnix"
            ports = [{containerPort = 80}]
        }
        service.ports = [{ port = 80 }]
    }
    deployment_got = kubernetesRender(a)
    assert deployment_got[0].kind == "Deployment"
    assert deployment_got[1].kind == "Service"
}
```

You can run this test case and view the test results through `kcl test`.

After the test is passed, you will get the following results:

![test-pass](/img/blog/2023-11-30-kcl-0.7.0-release/test-pass.png)

If your test fails, `kcl test` will output error information to help you troubleshoot the problem.

![test-failed](/img/blog/2023-11-30-kcl-0.7.0-release/test-failed.png)

### KCL Package Management

The `update` command is added to the `kcl mod` command. The `update` command is used to automatically update local dependencies. `kcl mod update` will automatically download the missing third-party libraries for you. For details, please refer to: https://github.com/kcl-lang/kpm/pull/212

### KCL Import Tool

The KCL Import tool supports one-click generation of KCL configuration/models from YAML/JSON/CRD/Terraform Schema, realizing automated migration.

If you have the following yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

You can convert it to a KCL program through the command `kcl import test.yaml`.

```python
"""
This file was generated by the KCL auto-gen tool. DO NOT EDIT.
Editing this file might prove futile when you re-run the KCL auto-gen generate command.
"""

apiVersion = "apps/v1"
kind = "Deployment"
metadata = {
    name = "nginx-deployment"
    labels = {
        app = "nginx"
    }
}
spec = {
    replicas = 3
    selector = {
        matchLabels = {
            app = "nginx"
        }
    }
    template = {
        metadata = {
            labels = {
                app = "nginx"
            }
        }
        spec = {
            containers = [
                {
                    name = "nginx"
                    image = "nginx:1.14.2"
                    ports = [
                        {
                            containerPort = 80
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
