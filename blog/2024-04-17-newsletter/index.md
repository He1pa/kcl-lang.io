[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang) is a constraint-based record and functional language hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) that enhances the writing of complex configurations and polices, including those for cloud-native scenarios. With its advanced programming language technology and practices, KCL is dedicated to promoting better modularity, scalability, and stability for configurations. It enables simpler logic writing and offers ease of automation APIs and integration with homegrown systems.

This section will update the KCL language community's latest news, including features, website updates, and the latest community news, helping everyone better understand the KCL community!

## Overview

Thanks to to all contributors for their outstanding work over the past twenty days (2024.04.04 - 2024.04.17). Here is an overview of the key content.

**üèÑ Language Updates**

- The `instances()` method of Schema has added a new keyword parameter `full_pkg` for reading all instances corresponding to the Schema in the code.

```python
schema Person:
    name: str

alice = Person {name = "Alice"}
all_persons = Person.instances(True)
```

- Added the `template` system module for manipulation of templates in KCL.

```python
import template

content = template.execute("""\
<div class="entry">
{{#if author}}
<h1>{{firstName}} {{lastName}}</h1>
{{/if}}
</div>
""", {
  author: True,
  firstName: "Yehuda",
  lastName: "Katz",
})
```

**‚õµÔ∏è Toolchain Updates**

- The OverrideFile API supports modifying/deleting non-schema type fields.
- New ListVariable API for reading the values of variables in KCL files.

**üî• SDK Updates**

- The KCL Go SDK has been released in version 0.8.4.
- The KCL Rust SDK has added the `llvm` feature, allowing to choose whether to use the LLVM, defaulting to off. When the LLVM feature is turned off, binary size can be reduced by 90%. Dependencies can be added in the following way:

```shell
cargo add --git https://github.com/kcl-lang/lib
```

- The initial release of the KCL Node.js SDK. Repository link: [https://github.com/kcl-lang/lib/tree/main/nodejs](https://github.com/kcl-lang/lib/tree/main/nodejs). Contributions are welcome.

* `__test__/test_data/schema.k`

```python
schema AppConfig:
    replicas: int

app: AppConfig {
    replicas: 2
}
```

- `execProgram`

```ts
import { execProgram, ExecProgramArgs } from "kcl-lib";

function main() {
  const result = execProgram(
    new ExecProgramArgs(["__test__/test_data/schema.k"]),
  );
  console.log(result.yamlResult); // 'app:\n  replicas: 2'
}

main();
```

- `listVariables`

```ts
import { listVariables, ListVariablesArgs } from "kcl-lib";

function main() {
  const result = listVariables(
    ListVariablesArgs("__test__/test_data/schema.k", []),
  );
  console.log(result.variables["app"].value); // 'AppConfig {replicas: 2}'
}

main();
```

- `loadPackage`

```ts
import { loadPackage, LoadPackageArgs } from "kcl-lib";

function main() {
  const result = loadPackage(
    LoadPackageArgs(["__test__/test_data/schema.k"], [], true),
  );
  console.log(result.symbols);
}

main();
```

**üíª IDE Updates**

- Added compilation unit caching to enhance IDE performance.

**üåº Integration Updates**

- Crossplane KCL Function supports reading Function Context parameters for passing parameters to different functions.
  - Support reading the function context across different functions.
  - Support reading the function details to set sensitive information.
  - Support setting the status field of XR to output user information.
  - Fixed errors related to concurrent requests when issuing clusters under multiple XR resources.
- KCL has released a Nix package, allowing installation of the KCL command line tools with `nix-shell` or `devbox shell`.
