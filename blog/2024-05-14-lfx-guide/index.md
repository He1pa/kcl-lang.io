[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang) is a constraint-based record and functional language hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) that enhances the writing of complex configurations, including those for cloud-native scenarios. With its advanced programming language technology and practices, KCL is dedicated to promoting better modularity, scalability, and stability for configurations. It enables simpler logic writing and offers ease of automation APIs and integration with homegrown systems.

For those interested in cloud-native, platform engineering,compiler, package management tools, and IDEs, we invite you to apply for the 2024 Linux Foundation LFX Mentorship project. You can earn a minimum of $3000 for completing the project! Apply now!

## LFX Mentorship Project

We have three Mentorship projects, covering package management tools, compiler, and IDEs.

#### 1. KCL Package Management Dependencies Sparse Checkout

`kpm` is a package management tool for KCL. When the scale of KCL project becomes larger and larger, and the external packages that KCL project relies on become more and more, `kpm` will become slow due to the need to download a large number of third-party dependencies. `kpm` needs to support `Sparse-Checkout`, which means downloading specific dependencies as needed rather than all of them, to improve the performance of the kpm.

#### 2. Optimization of KCL LSP prompt information

Optimize KCL LSP(language server protocol) prompt information, including the implementation of type inlayhint and optimization of hover content rendering. Currently, KCLâ€™s hover content is in plain text format and needs to be rendered into a more beautiful style.

#### 3. Supports tree-sitter for KCL

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. In order to support more features of the IDE, we need a more complete syntax tree, and for easy integration with the community, we intend to use tree-sitter to build a more complete parser system for KCL.
