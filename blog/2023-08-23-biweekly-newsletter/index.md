[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang) is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language that enhances the writing of complex configurations, including those for cloud-native scenarios. With its advanced programming language technology and practices, KCL is dedicated to promoting better modularity, scalability, and stability for configurations. It enables simpler logic writing and offers ease of automation APIs and integration with homegrown systems.

This section will update the KCL language community's latest developments every two weeks, including features, website updates, and the latest community news, helping everyone better understand the KCL community!

## Featured Updates

### KCL Import Tool Updates

The KCL Import Tool now adds support for converting Terraform Provider Schema to KCL Schema based on Protobuf, JsonSchema OpenAPI models, and Go Structures, such as the following Terraform Provider Json (obtained through the command `terraform providers schema -json > provider.json` , For more details, please refer to [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/providers/schema](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/providers/schema))

                "description_kind": "plain",
                "optional": true,
                "computed": true

                "type": [
                  "list",
                  [
                    "object",
                    {
                      "compliance_type": "string",
                      "count": "number"
                    }
                  ]
                ],
                "description_kind": "plain",
                "computed": true
              },
              "resource_types_scope": {
                "type": ["list", "string"],
                "description_kind": "plain",
                "optional": true,
                "computed": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "data_source_schemas": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Then the tool can output the following KCL code

```python
"""
This file was generated by the KCL auto-gen tool. DO NOT EDIT.
Editing this file might prove futile when you re-run the KCL auto-gen generate command.
"""

schema AlicloudConfigRule:
    """
    AlicloudConfigRule

    Attributes
    ----------
    compliance: [ComplianceObject], optional
    resource_types_scope: [str], optional
    """

    compliance?: [ComplianceObject]
    resource_types_scope?: [str]

schema ComplianceObject:
    """
    ComplianceObject

    Attributes
    ----------
    compliance_type: str, optional
    count: int, optional
    """

    compliance_type?: str
    count?: int

schema AlicloudDbInstance:
    """
    AlicloudDbInstance

    Attributes
    ----------
    db_instance_type: str, optional
    engine: str, required
    security_group_ids: [str], optional
    security_ips: [str], optional
    tags: {str:str}, optional
    """

    db_instance_type?: str
    engine: str
    security_group_ids?: [str]
    security_ips?: [str]
    tags?: {str:str}

    check:
        isunique(security_group_ids)
        isunique(security_ips)
```

### KCL Vault Integration

In just three steps, we can use Vault to store and manage sensitive information and use it in KCL.

Firstly, we install and use `Vault` to store `foo` and `bar` information

```shell
vault kv put secret/foo foo=foo
vault kv put secret/bar bar=bar
```

Then write the following KCL code (main.k)

```python
apiVersion = "apps/v1"
kind = "Deployment"
metadata = {
    name = "nginx"
    labels.app = "nginx"
    annotations: {
        "secret-store": "vault"
        # Valid format:
        #  "ref+vault://PATH/TO/KV_BACKEND#/KEY"
        "foo": "ref+vault://secret/foo#/foo"
        "bar": "ref+vault://secret/bar#/bar"
    }
}
spec = {
    replicas = 3
    selector.matchLabels = metadata.labels
    template.metadata.labels = metadata.labels
    template.spec.containers = [
        {
            name = metadata.name
            image = "${metadata.name}:1.14.2"
            ports = [{ containerPort = 80 }]
        }
    ]
}
```

Finally, the decrypted configuration can be obtained through the `Vals` command-line tool

```shell
kcl main.k | vals eval -f -
```
