## üìö Key Updates

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance Enhancements

#### Runtime Performance

In the new KCL v0.9 release, a new fast runtime mode has been introduced. This can be enabled by setting the `KCL_FAST_EVAL=1` environment variable, which improves startup and runtime performance. For configurations using Schema (such as the `k8s` third-party library), this offers approximately a **3x** performance boost compared to previous versions. For simple configurations without Schema, output YAML performance has been tested to surpass tools like `helm template` and `kustomize build` that use YAML and Go Templates.

#### IDE Performance

KCL IDE has further optimized incremental compilation and performance for semantic analysis in large projects. For KCL projects with around 400 files, the end-to-end response time has been reduced to **20%** of the previous version.

### üîß Core Features

#### Language

- String interpolation now supports escaping with `\${}` similar to Shell to cancel interpolation.

```python
world = "world"
hello_world_0 = "hello ${world}"  # hello world
hello_world_1 = "hello \${world}" # hello ${world}
```

- Added schema type support to the `typeof` function for distinguishing schema types from instances.

```python
schema Foo:
    bar?: str

foo = Foo {}
type_schema = typeof(foo) # schema
type_type = typeof(Foo) # type
```

- Added a `full_pkg` keyword argument to the `instances()` method of Schema to read instances of the corresponding schema from all code.

```python
schema Person:
    name: str

alice = Person {name = "Alice"}
all_persons = Person.instances(True)
```

- Removed implicit comparison between bool and int types `0 < True`.
- Removed comparison features for the list type `[0] < [1]`.
- Added type assertion failure functionality to the `as` keyword.
- Optimized closure variable capture logic of `lambda` functions and configuration code blocks `{}` in different scopes to be more intuitive.

#### Toolchain

- `kcl run` now supports outputting configurations in TOML format with the `--format` toml option.
- `kcl mod add` now supports adding dependencies from private third-party OCI Registries and Git repositories with the `--oci` and `--git` options.
- `kcl import` now supports importing entire Go Packages as KCL Schemas.
- `kcl import` now supports importing files with YAML stream format (`---`).
- `kcl import` now supports importing TOML files as KCL configurations.
- `kcl clean` now supports cleaning external dependencies and compile caches.
- `kcl mod init` now supports setting the version of a new KCL module with the `--version` tag.
- Commands like `kcl run`, `kcl mod add`, and `kcl mod pull` now support accessing private repositories via local Git.

#### IDE

- Supports multiple quick fix options.
- Syntax highlighting for `kcl.mod` and `kcl.mod.lock` files.
- Partial syntax hover highlighting in the IDE.
- `import` completion for external dependencies.
- Function symbol highlighting and Inlay Hints displaying default variable types.

#### API

- The Override API now supports setting different attribute operators (`:`, `=`, and `+=`) for configuration overrides.
- Go API now supports prototext format and KCL schema output as KCL configurations.
- Go API now supports serializing any Go Type and Go Value to KCL Schema and configurations.

### üì¶Ô∏è Standard Libraries and Third-Party Libraries

#### Standard Libraries

- Added the `file` standard library for file IO operations, such as reading configurations from YAML and performing configuration merges.

```python
import file
import yaml
import json_merge_patch as p

config = p.merge(yaml.decode(file.read("deployment.yaml")), {
    metadata.name = "override_value"
})
```

For more functions in the `file` module, see: [https://www.kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/model/file](https://www.kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/model/file)

- Added the `template` standard library for writing template configurations.

```python
import template

_data = {
    name = "handlebars",
    v = [ { a = 1 }, { a = 2 } ],
    c = { d = 5 },
    g = { b = [ { aa = { bb = 55} }, { aa = { bb = 66} } ] },
    people = [ "Yehuda Katz", "Alan Johnson", "Charles Jolley" ]
}

content = template.execute("""\
Hello world from {{name}}

{{#each v}}
{{this.a}}
{{/each}}
{{ c.d }}
{{#each people}}
{{ this }}
{{/each}}
{{#each g.b}}
{{this.aa.bb}}
{{/each}}
""", _data)
```

- Added the `runtime` standard library for capturing runtime exceptions, useful for `kcl test` tool to test exception cases.

```python
import runtime

schema Person:
    name: str
    age: int

    check:
        0 <= age <= 120, "age must be in [1, 120], got ${age}"

test_person_check_error = lambda {
    assert runtime.catch(lambda {
        p = Person {name = "Alice", age: -1}
    }) == "age must be in [1, 120], got -1"
}
```

          # Read the XR
          oxr = option("params").oxr
          # Patch the XR with the status field
          dxr = oxr | {
              status.dummy = "cool-status"
          }
          # Construct a AWS bucket
          bucket = {
              apiVersion = "s3.aws.upbound.io/v1beta1"
              kind = "Bucket"
              metadata.annotations: {
                  "krm.kcl.dev/composition-resource-name" = "bucket"
              }
              spec.forProvider.region = option("oxr").spec.region
          }
          # Return the bucket and patched XR
          items = [bucket, dxr]

### üß© Multi-Language SDKs and Plugins

#### Multi-Language SDKs

The number of KCL multi-language SDKs has increased to **7**, currently supporting Rust, Go, Java, .NET, Python, Node.js, and WASM. These can be used without installing additional KCL command-line tools, optimizing the installation size to **90%** of previous versions and removing the need for complex system dependencies. Furthermore, each SDK provides the same APIs for code execution, code analysis, type parsing, and adding external dependencies. Here are some examples with the Java and C# SDKs:

- Java

```java
import com.kcl.api.API;
import com.kcl.api.Spec.ExecProgram_Args;
import com.kcl.api.Spec.ExecProgram_Result;

public class ExecProgramTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        API api = new API();
        ExecProgram_Result result = api
                .execProgram(ExecProgram_Args.newBuilder().addKFilenameList("path/to/kcl.k").build());
        System.out.println(result.getYamlResult());
    }
}
```

- C#

```csharp
namespace KclLib.Tests;

using KclLib.API;

public class KclLibAPITest
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var execArgs = new ExecProgram_Args();
        execArgs.KFilenameList.Add("path/to/kcl.k");
        var result = new API().ExecProgram(execArgs);
        Console.WriteLine(result.YamlResult);
    }
}
```

For more information on installing and using other SDKs, see [https://github.com/kcl-lang/lib](https://github.com/kcl-lang/lib)

#### Multi-Language Plugins

The number of KCL multi-language plugins has increased to **3**, currently supporting Go, Python, and Java. Only basic SDK dependencies are required to achieve seamless interoperation between common languages and KCL. Here are some examples with Python and Java plugins:

Write the following KCL code (main.k)

```python
import kcl_plugin.my_plugin

result = my_plugin.add(1, 1)
```

Use the Python SDK to register a Python function for calling in KCL

```python
import kcl_lib.plugin as plugin
import kcl_lib.api as api

plugin.register_plugin("my_plugin", {"add": lambda x, y: x + y})

def main():
    result = api.API().exec_program(
        api.ExecProgram_Args(k_filename_list=["main.k"])
    )
    assert result.yaml_result == "result: 2"

main()
```

Use the Java SDK to register a Java function for calling in KCL

```java
package com.kcl;

import com.kcl.api.API;
import com.kcl.api.Spec.ExecProgram_Args;
import com.kcl.api.Spec.ExecProgram_Result;

import java.util.Collections;

public class PluginTest {
    public static void main(String[] mainArgs) throws Exception {
        API.registerPlugin("my_plugin", Collections.singletonMap("add", (args, kwArgs) -> {
            return (int) args[0] + (int) args[1];
        }));
        ExecProgram_Result result = new API()
                .execProgram(ExecProgram_Args.newBuilder().addKFilenameList("main.k").build());
        System.out.println(result.getYamlResult());
    }
}
```
