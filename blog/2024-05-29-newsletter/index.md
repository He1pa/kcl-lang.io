[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl) is an open-source configuration and policy language hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Sandbox Project. Built on a foundation of constraints and functional programming principles, KCL enhances the process of writing complex configurations, particularly in cloud-native environments. By leveraging advanced programming language techniques, KCL promotes improved modularity, scalability, and stability in configuration management. It simplifies logic writing, offers easy-to-use automation APIs, and seamlessly integrates with existing systems.

This section will update the KCL language community's latest news, including features, website updates, and the latest community news, helping everyone better understand the KCL community!

## Overview

Thanks to all contributors for their outstanding work over the past two weeks (2024.05.15 - 2024.05.29). Here is an overview of the key content:

**üì¶Ô∏è Modules Updates**

- New module `difflib` added to support configuration comparison.

Through the `diff` method provided by the `difflib`, the configuration difference is output.

```python
import difflib
import yaml

data1 = {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "address": {
        "streetAddress": "1234 Main St",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "postalCode": "10001"
    },
    "phoneNumbers": [
        {
            "type": "home",
            "number": "212-555-1234"
        },
        {
            "type": "work",
            "number": "646-555-5678"
        }
    ]
}
data2 = {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "address": {
        "streetAddress": "1234 Main St",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "postalCode": None
    },
    "phoneNumbers": [
        {
            "type": "work",
            "number": "646-555-5678"
        }
    ]
}
diff = difflib.diff(yaml.encode(data1), yaml.encode(data2))
```
