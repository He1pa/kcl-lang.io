## Introduction

The KCL team is pleased to announce that **KCL v0.10.0 is now available**! This release has brought three key updates to everyone

WIP

[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang) is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). KCL improves the writing of numerous complex configurations, such as cloud-native scenarios, through its mature programming language technology and practice. It is dedicated to building better modularity, scalability, and stability around configurations, simpler logic writing, faster automation, and great built-in or API-driven integrations.

## ❤️ Special Thanks

**We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to all 120 community contributors who participated in the iteration from version v0.9 to v0.10 over the past 120 days. The following list is in no particular order.**
